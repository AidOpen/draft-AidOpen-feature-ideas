This is draft for ideas for features of AidOpen

###### About AidOpen :

AidOpen is non-profit open source connected platform for helping hands. The motto of the open platform is to connect every segment of a society to contribute, help volunteer and build a better society by giving aid to the people who need it. It's an interface for everyone to everyone to collaborate for a better world.

###### How it works :

It works when you code for it, back it, use it, contribute, volunteer, help & spread it for humanity. It is not under sole authority, yet it is personal for everyone in every sense. That is the true beauty of AidOpen.

This plaform connects NGOs, Govt., developers, hackers, corporates, volunteers, contributers and any other open minded segment of society. For an example, you have seen a slum where people don't have medicine. You can directly help them or take brief of what they need and broadcast it to AidOpen. Whoever wants to take responsibility, ie. volunteers, NGOs can reach and help them out. Hence even a small gesture of your kindness can change their lives.
